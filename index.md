## About Me

I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.  
My research lies at the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **robotics**, with a focus on embodied planning, cognitive reasoning, and optimization-based control.  
I have conducted research at UC Berkeley, Peking University, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.


## Research Interests

- **LLMs for Robotics**: task decomposition, world models, multi-agent coordination  
- **Embodied Planning & Control**: RNN-based optimization, skill transfer, human-robot interaction  
- **Metaheuristic Optimization**: adaptive stochastic methods for real-world tasks
